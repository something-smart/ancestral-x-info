### Notes:
* ∞ means the item is infinitely obtainable. If no number is listed, you can only get 1.
* Items are (generally) listed at the first obtainable point. Due to reasons such as delaying encounters, you may not be able to get them at that point.
* HMs are indicated when backtracking is required. If you already have the relevant HM when you reach the location, it's not listed.
* You can begin to farm money when you reach Santalune (from the cafe). Most people will give themselves infinite money here; technically, you do not have true infinite money until you reach the Berry Fields, due to the ability to grow berries, compost them into mulch, and sell the mulch.
